## Hi, I am Thiago Gon√ßalves Santos aka on github thiago662 üëç

### I am a Brazilian developer, I started my programming journey in 2017 when I started studying in high school with a technical IT course. After finishing high school I started college in 2020, in the same year in October I got my first job in the area, I finish college in 2022 and now I work at the same company Followize.

### I use my github to share my knowledge, development and creative projects, I hope to help many people with these things and learn new knowledge.
